# **Java Lesson 1.5**

## üî¢ Numbers - `int`s and `double`s

While there are several other numerical data types in Java, the 2 most commonly used are the `int` and `double` data types.

`int`s are integers (whole numbers) without decimal values. `double`s are decimal numbers that can have fractional parts.

### üìê Math

Numerical data are mostly used in mathematical operations.

#### ‚ûó Arithmetic operators

Below are the arithmetic operators in Java:

|      |   Operation    |        Description        |
| :--: | :------------: | :-----------------------: |
|  +   |    Addition    |       Add 2 numbers       |
|  -   |  Subtraction   |    Subtract 2 numbers     |
|  *   | Multiplication |    Multiply 2 numbers     |
|  /   |    Division    |     Divide 2 numbers      |
|  %   |    Modulus     | Get remainder of division |

```java
System.out.println(1 + 1);  // 2
System.out.println(5 - 2);  // 3
System.out.println(3 * 3);  // 9
System.out.println(5 / 2);  // 2
System.out.println(9 % 2);  // 1
```

All of these make sense, besides division. How is `5 / 2` equal to 2? Well, in Java, 2 `int`s dividing each other is known as *Integer Division*, where the remainder is removed. Essentially, the types of the operands decide the type of the result. When both operands are `int`s, the result is an `int`.

To get a more accurate answer for our division, we can add a `.0` after the two numbers so the operation results in a `double`.

```java
System.out.println(5.0 / 2.0);  // 2.5
```

#### ‚úñ `Math` class

In addition to the arithmetic operations, Java also has a collection of math-related methods in the `Math` class.

Here are some of the most useful:

* `Math.abs(x)`: Get the absolute value of `x`
* `Math.sqrt(x)`: Get the square root of `x`
* `Math.pow(x, y)`: Get `x` raised to the `y`th power
* `Math.min(x, y)`: Get the smaller value between `x` and `y`
* `Math.max(x, y)`: Get the larger value between `x` and `y`

```java
// Some examples
System.out.println(Math.abs(-10.1));
System.out.println(Math.sqrt(49));
System.out.println(Math.pow(2, 3));
System.out.println(Math.min(1, 2));
System.out.println(Math.max(-102.31, 1291.2));
```

##### üßÆ `Math.random()`

To generate a random number in Java, we can use the `Math.random` method, which returns a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive) - `[0.0, 1.0)`.

```java
System.out.println(Math.random());
```

A decimal number between 0 and 1 is useful, but what if we want a whole number between 1 and 10?

```java
System.out.println((int) (Math.random() * 10) + 1);
```

In general, if you want a whole number between `min` and `max` inclusive, the following formula can be used:

```java
(int) (Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min
```

### ‚úç Exercise: professional mathematician

Predict the output of the following math operations:

```java
System.out.println(10 / 3);
System.out.println(7 % 3);
System.out.println(Math.pow(3, 3));
```

#### üé≤ Challenge: dice roller

Use `Math.random` to produce a random integer between `1` and `6`.

```java
// Solution
System.out.println((int) (Math.random() * 6) + 1);
```

## üíª Summary

Numerical data is everywhere in our lives, and now you have Java as a tool to handle those data.
