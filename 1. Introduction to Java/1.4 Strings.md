# **Java Lesson 1.4**

## üî§ `String`

`String`s store text as sequences of characters. In Java, we enclose `String`s with double quotes.

### ‚ûï `String` Concatenation

We can combine multiple `String`s through *String concatenation* using the `+` operator.

```java
System.out.println("String " + "concatenation");  // Will print out "String concatenation"
```

### üî° Escape characters

There are some special characters that we can insert into `String`s, called *escape characters*.

| Character | Description        |
|-----------|--------------------|
| `\"`      | Double quote (`"`) |
| `\'`      | Single quote (`'`) |
| `\n`      | New line           |
| `\t`      | Horizontal tab     |
| `\\`      | Backslash (`\`)    |

```java
System.out.println("Hello\nHello again\nHello yet again\n");
System.out.println("\"Do the simplest thing that could possibly work\" - Kent Beck");
System.out.println("Hello\tworld!");
System.out.println("C:\\Windows\\System32");
```

### üìè Length of `String`s

We can find the length of a `String` in Java using the `length` method. Don't worry about what a method is for now, we will talk more on that later.

```java
System.out.println("Hello world!".length());  // Will print out 12
```

### üî† Case Converting

We can convert a `String` from UPPERCASE to lowercase and the other way around using the `toUpperCase` and `toLowerCase` methods.

```java
System.out.println("i am lowercase".toUpperCase());  // Will print "I AM LOWERCASE"
System.out.println("I AM UPPERCASE".toLowerCase());  // Will print "i am uppercase"
```

### ‚öñÔ∏è `equals` Method

We can compare 2 `String`s and see if they are equal using the `equals` method.

```java
System.out.println("Hello".equals("Hello"));  // true
System.out.println("HELLO".equals("hello"));  // false
```

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Getting substrings

A common task with `String`s in programming is obtaining *substrings* (parts of `Strings`) from a `String`. In Java, we can use the `substring` method.

Before we talk about using this method, we need to understand *indexing* in Java `String`s. When we want to locate a character in a `String`, we can use its position in that text. This is the character's *index*. In many programming languages including Java, the index of the first character is **0**, second character is **1**, etc.

```java
  "A String"
// 01234567
```

We can use the `substring` method in 2 ways:

* `substring(start, end)`: everything between `start` and `end`, including `start`, *excluding* `end`
* `substring(start)`: everything after `start`, including the character at `start`

```java
System.out.println("Good morning".substring(5));
System.out.println("Programming is really fun!".substring(12, 14));
```

### ‚úç Exercise: `String` operator

Let's practice working with `String`s! Given the `String`

`Good evening, Java!`

and the `String` operations you learned today, print the result of

`Evening Java!`

```java
// Sample solution
System.out.print("Good evening, Java!".substring(5, 6).toUpperCase());
System.out.print("Good evening, Java!".substring(6, 12));
System.out.print("Good evening, Java!".substring(13));
```

## üíª Summary

Much of the data we interact with in our daily lives are `String`s: text messages, emails, names, and so on... Now you have the ability to work with them in Java!
