# **Java Lesson 1.6**

## ‚úÖ `boolean`s

The last data type we will cover in this chapter is the `boolean`. A `boolean` data has 2 possible values, `true` and `false`. This is very useful when we want to store data that represents a **state** or **condition** (on/off or yes/no).

### ‚ùì Boolean expressions

`boolean`s are very useful when used in *boolean expressions* (conditional testings). Boolean expressions can be used to test if a condition is `true` or `false`.

The comparison operators `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` are often used in boolean expressions. `==` tests whether 2 numbers are equal. `!=` tests whether they are unequal.

```java
System.out.println(5 == 3);  // false
System.out.println(5 != 3);  // true
System.out.println(5 > 3);   // true
System.out.println(5 < 3);   // false
System.out.println(5 >= 3);  // true
System.out.println(5 <= 3);  // false
```

### ‚ùî Logical operators

We can also use **logical operators** to combine multiple boolean expressions into one. In Java,

* `&&` is the **and** operator: `true` if both sides are `true`
* `||` is the **or** operator: `true` if one or both sides are `true`
* `!` is the **not** operator: reverses `true` to `false`, `false` to `true`

```java
System.out.println(10 % 2 == 0 && 5 + 2 > 1);  // true
System.out.println(1 == 1 || 1 != 1);          // true
System.out.println(!false);                    // true
```

### ‚úç Exercise: to be `true` or not to be

Predict the output of the following `boolean` expressions:

```java
System.out.println(true || false);
System.out.println(false && true);
System.out.println(!(3 < 2) && !(true || false));
```

## üíª Summary

`booleans` are used all the time in programming. After learning about **conditional statements** in the next chapter, you will be able to write programs that "make decisions" and perform different tasks based on boolean expressions.
