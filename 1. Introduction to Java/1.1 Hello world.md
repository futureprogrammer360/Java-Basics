# **Java Lesson 1.1**

## ❓ What is Java?

* General-purpose programming language created in the 1990s
* Billions of devices around the world run Java
* What can *you* make with Java?
    - 📱 Mobile applications (Android)
    - 📊 Big data
    - 🌐 Web applications

## 📝 Where to write Java code?

Java can be downloaded and installed onto our local computers, but in order to get into coding faster, we're going to use an online Java development environment.
Feel free to use any editor you find online, but I'm going to use [Replit's Java editor](https://replit.com/languages/java "Replit Java online editor").

After you open the editing environment you chose, spend a few minutes to play around with the editor's interface.

## 👋 Hello world

One of the most basic operations that Java can perform, is displaying information.

For that, we can use 2 of Java's print statements:
```java
System.out.println();
System.out.print();
```
In your code editor, type in
```java
System.out.println("Hello, world!");
```
and run the code.

If you see `Hello, world!` printed onto your screen, congratulations! You have successfully written and executed your first Java program!

Let's look at each part of the program we just wrote:

* `class Main`: defining a class
* `public static void main(String args[])`: defining a special method called `main`
* `System.out.println()`: a method that prints information
* `"Hello, world!"`: `String` we want to print out
* `{}`: marks a block of code
* `;`: marks the end of a statement

Right now, don't worry if you don't understand any of the terminologies above, we will learn more about each as we continue this course.

The difference between the two print statements shown above is that `System.out.println();` moves the cursor to the next line after printing the message while `System.out.print();` keeps the cursor on the same line.
See the difference for yourself in the code editor!

### ✍ Exercise: introduction

Using the 2 print statements that you just learned, display a short introduction about yourself. Try to use a combination of both statements!
```java
System.out.print("Hello! ");
System.out.println("This is a sample introduction written in Java!");
```

## 💻 Summary

Good job! You have successfully written your first program in Java. While your code may seem very primitive and simple right now, our program will become more complex and useful as we learn more about programming.
