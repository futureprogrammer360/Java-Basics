# **Java Basics 1.8**

## ‚ùî User Input

In our `Hello world` program from before, we learned about how to **output** information onto the screen using Java. Getting **inputs** from users is just as important in programming.

A word of warning: getting user inputs in Java is a bit complicated and not exactly straightforward. We'll be using things like classes, objects, and methods to do so. Do not worry if these appear as magic at this point, as they will be discussed later in this course.

### ‚ùì `Scanner` class

In Java, the `Scanner` class is used to get user inputs. For now, think about classes as collections of related code - which isn't the exact definition, but it's helpful for this lesson.

To use code from the `Scanner` class, we have to `import` it first (**at the top of the file before the class definition**):

```java
import java.util.Scanner;
```

And then, we need to create an **instance** of the `Scanner` class which we'll use to get the inputs.

```java
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);  // sc is a variable!
```

Now we can get user inputs!

```java
System.out.print("Your name: ");
String name = sc.nextLine();
System.out.println("Hello, " + name);
```

`.nextLine()` lets us read `String` inputs. We can use `nextInt()` and `nextDouble()` to get numerical data!

```java
System.out.print("Your favorite whole number: ");
int intNum = sc.nextInt();
System.out.println(intNum);

System.out.print("Your favorite decimal number: ");
double doubleNum = sc.nextDouble();
System.out.println(doubleNum);
```

### ‚úç Exercise: addition experts

Use the `Scanner` class to get 2 numbers from the user. Then add them!

```java
// Example solution
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
System.out.print("First number: ");
double num1 = sc.nextDouble();
System.out.print("Second number: ");
double num2 = sc.nextDouble();
System.out.println("Sum: " + (num1 + num2));
```

## üíª Summary

Congratulations! You now know how to get inputs from users. Next, we will use this knowledge to create some fun projects!
