# **Java Lesson 1.2**

## üìú Comments

When writing programs, it is possible for the programmer to forget what a particular line or section of the program does. In those situations, we can use *comments* to include human-readable explanations among the code.

Comments are ignored by the Java compiler, so we can also comment out code when we don't want a line to run.

In Java, a single-line comment starts with a `//`.
```java
// System.out.print("This line is not run");
System.out.println("Hi");  // Some random explanation
```
We can also write longer multi-line (block) comments between `/*` and `*/`. Any text between will be ignored.

```java
/* This is a multi-line comment
ignored by the Java compiler
The following line is a print statement */
System.out.println("There is a multi-line comment above me!");
```

### ‚úç Exercise: a friendly reminder

Write a program that prints out some information, and then use either (or both!) a single-line and/or multi-line comment(s) to explain what your current program does. Be creative!

```java
/* This program prints out a sentence describing
the Java programming language. */
// The lines above contain a multi-line comment
System.out.println("Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language");
```

## üíª Summary

Comments are an extremely useful part of any program. Correctly using comments can increase code readability and help others understand your programs.
