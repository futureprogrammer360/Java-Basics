# **Java Lesson 1.3**

## üìà Data Types

Data is everywhere nowadays, so it's no surprise that data largely forms the foundation of computer programming. In Java (and other programming languages too), data is divided into different categories. Different data types are used to store different information, and can be used to do different things.

Below are some of the most common and basic data types in Java:

* `String`: stores text (sequence of characters)
    - `"Hello world"`, `"123"`, `"!*@!#&!@*#&!()@#*&"`
* `int`: stores integers (whole numbers)
    - `123`, `-49098`
* `double`: stores decimal numbers (non-whole numbers)
    - `0.000001`, `-192837192387.0`
* `boolean`: stores truth values
    - `true`, `false`

### ‚úç Exercise: data type detective

Below are some data. Identify which data types they belong to in Java.
```java
1. "false"
2. 3.14159
3. "Hey, who am I?"
4. true
5. 0
```
```java
1. String
2. double
3. String
4. boolean
5. int
```

## üíª Summary

Data types is one of the foundational concepts in programming, and the knowledge you have gained today will help you throughout the rest of your programming career.

In the next few lessons of this course, we will take a closer look at the most common data types used in Java programming.
