# **Java Lesson 5.3**

## üè° Constructors as a concept

Last lesson, we learned how to store object properties with instance attributes and define object behaviors with instance methods. Today, we will look at constructors in Java classes.

A constructor is a special instance method of any Java class that is called when an instance of the class is created, thus the name "constructor".

Constructors are usually used to initialize instance attributes. Think about the `Robot` class we used as example previously. What if we want to assign a name to our robots when we create them? We can't define that information in the class definition, since different robots have different names. But because the constructor is called every time an instance of the class is created, we can initialize the `name` instance attribute in the constructor using a value passed in as argument.

## üíª Constructors as Java code

As we continue this lesson, remember that constructors are just instance methods. But they are special. There're two important things to keep in mind regarding constructors:

* They do not have a return type. Not even `void`
* The name of the constructor must match the name of the class

```java
class Robot {
    public Robot() {
        System.out.println("New robot created.");
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Robot robot1 = new Robot();
        Robot robot2 = new Robot();
        Robot robot3 = new Robot();
    }
}
```

Because the constructor is called every time we construct an instance of the `Robot` class, we get three lines of output when our program runs.

All classes have constructors. If you do not explicitly define one, then Java will do it for you, essentially adding an empty constructor to your class. But if we want to use a constructor to initialize some instance attributes when creating our objects, we can do something like this...

```java
class Robot {
    String name;
    boolean canFly;
    int age;

    public Robot(String n, boolean f) {
        name = n;
        canFly = f;
        age = 0;
    }

    public void sayHi() {
        System.out.println("\nHello! My name is " + name + " and I am " + age);
        if (canFly) {
            System.out.println("I can fly");
        }
    }
}
```

Now, when we create a `Robot` object, we pass in two values: the name of the robot, and whether it can fly.

```java
Robot robot = new Robot("DuckBot", false);
robot.sayHi();

Robot anotherRobot = new Robot("BirdBot", true);
anotherRobot.age++;
anotherRobot.age++;
anotherRobot.sayHi();
```

### ‚úç Exercise: construction project

Now that you've learned about constructors, write a Java class that has a constructor in addition to instance attributes and methods. Create a few instances of the class with different properties. Feel free to make the class a blueprint of anything you can think of.

```java
class Rocket {
    String name;
    String manufacturer;
    int numStages;
    boolean isManned;
    boolean isActive;
    boolean isReusable;

    public Rocket(String n, String m, int s, boolean d, boolean a, boolean r) {
        name = n;
        manufacturer = m;
        numStages = s;
        isManned = d;
        isActive = a;
        isReusable = r;
        System.out.println(name + " constructed successfully.");
    }

    public void displayInformation() {
        System.out.println("Rocket name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Manufacturer: " + manufacturer);
        System.out.println("Number of stages: " + numStages);
        System.out.println("Other information:");
        System.out.println("  Manned: " + isManned);
        System.out.println("  Active: " + isActive);
        System.out.println("  Reusable: " + isReusable);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rocket falcon9 = new Rocket("Falcon 9", "SpaceX", 2, true, true, true);
        falcon9.displayInformation();
        System.out.println();

        Rocket saturnV = new Rocket("Saturn V", "NASA", 3, true, false, false);
        saturnV.displayInformation();
    }
}
```

## üëÜ `this` keyword

To eliminate confusion when referencing an instance attribute as opposed to a method parameter, we can use the keyword `this` to explicitly indicate that we're talking about the instance attribute. `this` references the current instance of the class.

While it's not required in many places, `this` can help improve code readability in many situations. Below is a modified program that takes advantage of the `this` keyword. A new method `dock` is also added.

```java
class Rocket {
    String name;
    String manufacturer;
    int numStages;
    boolean isManned;
    boolean isActive;
    boolean isReusable;

    public Rocket(String name, String manufacturer, int numStages, boolean isManned, boolean isActive, boolean isReusable) {
        this.name = name;
        this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
        this.numStages = numStages;
        this.isManned = isManned;
        this.isActive = isActive;
        this.isReusable = isReusable;
        System.out.println(name + " constructed successfully.");
    }

    public void displayInformation() {
        System.out.println("Rocket name: " + this.name);
        System.out.println("Manufacturer: " + this.manufacturer);
        System.out.println("Number of stages: " + this.numStages);
        System.out.println("Other information:");
        System.out.println("  Manned: " + this.isManned);
        System.out.println("  Active: " + this.isActive);
        System.out.println("  Reusable: " + this.isReusable);
    }

    public void dock(Rocket other) {
        System.out.println(this.name + " docked with " + other.name);
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Rocket falcon9 = new Rocket("Falcon 9", "SpaceX", 2, true, true, true);
        falcon9.displayInformation();
        System.out.println();

        Rocket saturnV = new Rocket("Saturn V", "NASA", 3, true, false, false);
        saturnV.displayInformation();

        System.out.println();

        falcon9.dock(saturnV);
    }
}
```

## üíª Summary

Constructors add a layer of convenience for object-oriented programming, and is super useful when defining classes and creating objects.
