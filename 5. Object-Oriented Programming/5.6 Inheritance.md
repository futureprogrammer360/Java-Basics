# **Java Lesson 5.6**

## üë™ Inheritance

An important concept in object-oriented programming is called **inheritance**. Outside of programming, inheritance generally means a child inheriting the qualities of their parents. In programming, inheritance means pretty much the same thing!

Inheritance allows a **child class** (subclass) to inherit the fields and methods of a **parent class** (superclass), just like how a child could possibly inherit the properties and behaviors of a parent.

All Java classes implicitly inherit the `Object` class, which defines the most general properties and behaviors of any Java class. Subclasses specify more detailed behaviors and properties specific to each class.

### Inheritance in Java

Phones and laptops are both computers, meaning they share common characteristics of computers. For that reason, we can let the `Phone` and `Laptop` classes inherit from the `Computer` class. That way, we can define general behaviors like `powerOn()`, `powerOff()` and properties like `brand` in the `Computer` class. Then, in the `Phone` and `Laptop` subclasses, we can define behaviors and properties more specific to phones and laptops in addition to those in the parent class.

The example above can be written in Java as such:

```java
class Computer {
    private String brand;

    public Computer(String brand) {
        this.brand = brand;
    }

    public void powerOn() {
        System.out.println("Powering on...");
    }

    public void powerOff() {
        System.out.println("Powering off...");
    }

    public String getBrand() {
        return this.brand;
    }
}

class Phone extends Computer {
    private int number;

    public Phone(String brand, int number) {
        super(brand);
        this.number = number;
    }

    public void makePhoneCall(int number) {
        System.out.println("Calling " + number + "...");
    }
}

class Laptop extends Computer {
    private String operatingSystem;
    private String user;

    public Laptop(String brand, String operatingSystem, String user) {
        super(brand);
        this.operatingSystem = operatingSystem;
        this.user = user;
    }

    public void switchUser(String user) {
        System.out.println("Switching to " + user + "...");
        this.user = user;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer c = new Computer("Apple");
        c.powerOn();
        System.out.println(c.getBrand());
        c.powerOff();
        System.out.println();

        Phone p = new Phone("Samsung", 123);
        p.powerOn();
        System.out.println(p.getBrand());
        p.makePhoneCall(321);
        p.powerOff();
        System.out.println();

        Laptop l = new Laptop("HP", "Windows", "admin123");
        l.powerOn();
        System.out.println(l.getBrand());
        l.switchUser("admin321");
        l.powerOff();
    }
}
```

What a long example program! Let's take a look at the code piece by piece.

We first have a superclass called `Computer` with the public instance attribute `brand` and methods `powerOn()` and `powerOff()`. Nothing unusual about this class.

Now let's look at the subclasses `Phone` and `Laptop`. To specify that they are inheriting the `Computer` parent class, we use the `extends` keyword. So the class headers read `class SUBCLASS extends SUPERCLASS`.

The two subclasses each have some properties and methods specific to each, but the important thing is in the constructors. In the `Phone` and `Laptop` constructors, the first line is `super(brand);`. This is a method call to the constructor of the parent class `Computer`, with the `brand` as argument. Only after this superclass constructor call is done, do we assign other instance attribute values.

Now let's think a little about the inheritance at work here. Because `Phone` and `Laptop` inherit `Computer`, the objects of all three classes will all have a `brand` attribute. The `powerOn()` and `powerOff` methods are also inherited so they can be called from instances of all three classes.

Inheritance does not work backward, so while a `Phone` or a `Laptop` **is a** `Computer` and thus inherit properties and behaviors thereof, a `Computer` does not have the properties and methods of a `Phone` or `Laptop`.

Something to note is that `private` members of a class are not inherited by subclasses. But public getters and setters can still be used to access/modify private fields.

### ‚úç Exercise: inheritance

Using the example above as a model, write a superclass with one or more subclasses inheriting it. If you need some ideas, consider things like transportation vehicles, animals, jobs, etc.

## üíª Summary

Inheritance can be hard to grasp at first, so make sure to practice!
