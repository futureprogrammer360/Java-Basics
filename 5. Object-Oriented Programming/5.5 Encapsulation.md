# **Java Lesson 5.5**

## 🏘 Encapsulation

Today's OOP topic is **encapsulation**, which is also called "data hiding". In short, encapsulation means restricting the access of certain data to the class it is located in.

To accomplish the encapsulation of an instance attribute, we need to declare it to be a `private` variable so it can only be directly accessed from within its class.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private String job;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, String job, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.job = job;
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Joe", "Student", 10);
        System.out.println(p.name);  // ⛔
    }
}
```

Now our data (the instance attributes) is hidden from the rest of the world using the `private` modifier. But some data are necessary for the rest of the program. How can we access and modify these private instance attributes then?

### 📭 Getters

A `private` instance attribute cannot be accessed from a different class. But we can use a `public` method to return that value, since the method can be accessed from outside its class due to the `public` modifier.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private String job;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, String job, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.job = job;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return this.name;
    }

    public String getJob() {
        return this.job;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return this.age;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Joe", "Student", 10);
        System.out.println(p.getName());  // ✅
        System.out.println(p.getJob());   // ✅
        System.out.println(p.getAge());   // ✅
    }
}
```

### 📫 Setters

We can't modify private instance variables outside of their class either. Similar to getters, we can create public "setter" methods that we can call to change the attributes' values.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private String job;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, String job, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.job = job;
        this.age = age;
    }

    public String getName() { return this.name; }
    public String getJob() { return this.job; }
    public int getAge() { return this.age; }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public void setJob(String job) {
        this.job = job;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Joe", "Student", 10);
        p.setJob("Intern");
        System.out.println(p.getJob());
    }
}
```

### ✍ Exercise: getters and setters

Practice setting your instance attributes `private` and using getters and setters to access and modify the values of the attributes.

### 👍 Benefits of encapsulation

It may appear with the simple example programs above that getters and setters are just solutions to encapsulation, a challenge we create for ourselves. And while encapsulation might appear utterly useless right now, it actually has plenty of benefits like data protection, code readability, etc. It's also a very good and common practice to hide some data within classes that should not be accessed or modified from the outside.

A more practical advantage that encapsulation has is restricting data modification. In our `Person` class, age is always going to be non-negative. We can make sure of that in the `setAge()` setter method so no invalid value will be set.

```java
class Person {
    private String name;
    private String job;
    private int age;

    public Person(String name, String job, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.job = job;
    }

    public String getName() { return this.name; }
    public String getJob() { return this.job; }
    public int getAge() { return this.age; }

    public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
    public void setJob(String job) { this.job = job; }
    public void setAge(int age) {
        if (age >= 0) {
            this.age = age;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Invalid age: age must be non-negative.");
        }
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Person p = new Person("Joe", "Student", 10);
        p.setAge(100);
        System.out.println(p.getAge());
        p.setAge(-8);
        System.out.println(p.getAge());
    }
}
```
