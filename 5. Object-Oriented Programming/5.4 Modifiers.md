# **Java Lesson 5.4**

## ðŸ”” Modifiers

Have you wondered what modifiers such as `public` and `static` are and when each should be included? This lesson is on modifiers and how to use them to modify methods, attributes, etc.

Modifiers can be categorized into several groups. Today, we're going to mainly focus on **access modifiers** and the **non-access modifier**s `static` and `final`.

## ðŸšª Access modifiers

Access modifiers determine how and where something can be accessed. The two we need to worry about right now are `public` and `private`.

Like the names suggest,

* `public` makes a variable, method, or class accessible to all parts of the program
* `private` makes code accessible only to the class it is in

```java
class City {
    public String name;
    private int population;

    public City(String name, int population) {
        this.name = name;
        this.population = population;
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        City somewhere = new City("City", 12345);

        System.out.println(somewhere.name);
        System.out.println(somewhere.population);
    }
}
```

The instance attribute `name` is `public`, so it can be accessed directly in another class with dot-notation. `population` on the other hand, has private access in the `City` class, meaning an attempt to access the `population` instance attribute outside of the `City` class will result in an error.

In the next lesson of this course, we will discuss **encapsulation**, which is the restriction of data access from across classes. We'll also talk about how to access and modify private instance attributes.

`public` and `private` can also be used to modify methods. A `private` method can only be called from within the same class whereas a `public` one can be called from anywhere in the program.

## ðŸ›  Non-access modifiers

Some modifiers do not modify access control. The two we're focusing on today are `static` and `final`.

### ðŸŒŒ `static`

The `static` keyword changes whether a method or attribute is of a **class** or of an **object**. A non-`static` (instance) method for instance, must be called from an instance of the class (an object), whereas a `static` method can be called directly from the class without creating any objects.

```java
class Store {
    private String name;
    private int id;
    public static int numStores = 0;
    public static int nextId = 1;
    public static ArrayList<Store> stores = new ArrayList<Store>();

    public Store(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = nextId;
        stores.add(this);
        numStores++;
        nextId++;
    }

    public void printInformation() {
        System.out.println("Store name: " + this.name);
        System.out.println("Store ID: " + this.id);
    }

    public static void closeAllStores() {
        System.out.println("All stores have been closed.");
        numStores = 0;
        nextId = 1;
        stores.clear();
    }
}

class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(Store.numStores);

        Store store1 = new Store("Store 1");
        System.out.println(Store.numStores);

        Store store2 = new Store("Store 2");
        System.out.println(Store.numStores);

        System.out.println("\nStores:");
        for (Store s : Store.stores) {
            s.printInformation();
        }

        Store.closeAllStores();
    }
}
```

### â›” `final`

Some variables are constant, meaning they are not meant to be modified after initialization. The `final` modifier makes it so that modifying a variable will raise an error, informing us that we are trying to change a variable that we believe should not be changed. This way, these variables will not be changed by accident. **Constants** declared to be `final` are usually in uppercase.

```java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final double PI = 3.14159265359;
        final double E = 2.718281828459045;

        PI = 2.14159265359;
    }
}
```

## ðŸ’» Summary

Modifiers change how code behave, and is an important part of Java programming. You will certainly apply what you learned in this lesson in future programs.
