# **Java Lesson 2.4**

## 🚧 Branching statements

Now that we have learned about the `while`, `do`-`while`, and `for` loops, it's time to learn about the branching statements in Java related to loops:

* `break`
* `continue`

### 🚫 `break`

The `break` statement is used to **break** ("jump out of") a loop. The program will leave the loop as soon as a `break` statement is run.

```java
int num = 10;
while (num < 1000000000) {
    System.out.println(num);
    num++;
    if (num == 12) {
        break;  // Leave the loop immediately
    }
}
```

`break` can also be used in a `for` loop.

```java
for (int j = 50; j > 0; j -= 1) {
    System.out.println(j);
    if (j == 45) {
        break;
    }
}
```

### ⏭ `continue`

The `continue` statement jumps out of the current loop iteration and **continues** to the next time the loop runs.

```java
int i = 1;
while (i < 10) {
    i++;
    if (i % 2 == 1) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println("i: " + i);
}
```

Like `break`, `continue` can also be placed in `for` loops. An example is below:

```java
int num;
for (num = 1; num < 10; num += 2) {
    if (num == 5 || num == 9) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println(num);
}
```

### ✍ Exercise: leaving and skipping

Write a `for` loop that runs over the integers from 1 to 10 (including both). Print these numbers out, skipping the even numbers, and exiting the loop after printing out 5.

```java
// Example solution
for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    if (i % 2 == 0) {
        continue;
    }
    System.out.println(i);
    if (i == 5) {
        break;
    }
}
```

## 💻 Summary

`break` and `continue` are useful in fully controlling your loops, making them do exactly what you want.
