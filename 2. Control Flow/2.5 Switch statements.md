# **Java Lesson 2.5**

## üîÄ `switch` statement

Remember when we learned about conditional statements a few lessons back? We talked about `if`, `else if`, and `else`. These statements give us the ability to do different things depending on conditions.

Sometimes, we may need to write programs that, for example, convert numbers to the corresponding days of the week (eg: 1 to Monday). We can do this with conditional statements like in the code below.

```java
int day = 3;
if (day == 1) {
    System.out.println("Monday");
} else if (day == 2) {
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
} else if (day == 3) {
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
} else if (day == 4) {
    System.out.println("Thursday");
} else if (day == 5) {
    System.out.println("Friday");
} else if (day == 6) {
    System.out.println("Saturday");
} else if (day == 7) {
    System.out.println("Sunday");
}
```

In addition to using this style of program as shown above, Java also offers the `switch` statement, which can sometimes make our code cleaner and easier to read.

`switch` statements can only be used to do **case-matching**. An expression is tested against different cases. The syntax is shown below:

```java
switch (expression) {
    case caseA:
        // Some code to run if expression matches caseA
    case caseB:
        // Some code to run if expression matches caseB
    // More cases to match
    default:
        // Some code to run if none of the cases above were matched
}
```

Java compares the `expression` with the values of each `case` (`caseA`, `caseB`, etc). If a case matches the `expression`, the code under that `case` **and those under subsequent `case`s** will run. If none of the `case`s were matched, the code under `default` will be run.

We can also write the weekday conversion program above using `switch`-`case`. The `expression` we want to test is the `int` variable `day`. We will test it against the numbers 1-7.

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
    case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");
    case 5:
        System.out.println("Friday");
    case 6:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
}
```

Hold up! The only output should be `Wednesday`. Why were `Thursday`, `Friday`, `Saturday`, and `Sunday` printed out? This is because after one `case` matches, all the `case`s after that one will also run. Until a `break` is reached at least.

### `break` in `switch`-`case`

When a `case` matches the `expression`, the statements after that `case` will all run until a `break` is reached (or the switch statement ends).

```java
int day = 3;
switch (day) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Monday");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Tuesday");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Wednesday");
        break;
    case 4:
        System.out.println("Thursday");
        break;
    case 5:
        System.out.println("Friday");
        break;
    case 6:
        System.out.println("Saturday");
        break;
    case 7:
        System.out.println("Sunday");
        break;
}
```

Now, after `Wednesday` is printed out, the `switch` statement is terminated by the `break` statement, so none of the other `case`s will be run.

### `default`

`default` in `switch` statements is similar to `else` in conditional statements. If none of the specified `case`s matched the `expression`, the code under `default` will run.

```java
int i = 0;  // Let's pretend i can only be -1, 0, or 1
switch (i) {
    case -1:
        System.out.println("Negative");
        break;
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Positive");
        break;
    default:
        System.out.println("Zero");
}
```

### ‚úç Exercise: the months of the year

Using `switch`-`case`, convert numbers to the four seasons of the year:

* 1: spring
* 2: summer
* 3: fall
* 4: winter

```java
// Example solution
int season = 2;
switch (season) {
    case 1:
        System.out.println("Spring");
        break;
    case 2:
        System.out.println("Summer");
        break;
    case 3:
        System.out.println("Fall");
        break;
    case 4:
        System.out.println("Winter");
        break;
}
```

## üíª Summary

In some cases, `switch`-`case` offers a more elegant way of testing an expression against values.
